useState preserves the value and triggers rerendering?????!

USEEFFECT
useEffect is used for operations outside of the component. Beware when using useEffect and useState together. if you're passing in a value in useState that will cause the browser to rerender, and pass in the useState again, it'll lead to an infinite loop. 
// by default runs after every re-render

// second parameter
-array in useEffect second parameter is called the array of dependencies
if left blank, useEffect will only run on intial rendering 


// cleanup function
