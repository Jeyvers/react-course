useReducer hook

- useReducer is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second. 
// so dispatch is the initial state. 

Three main building blocks in Redux 
a. A store - an immutable object that holds the applications state data
b. A reducer - a function that returns some state data, triggered by an action type
c. An action - an object that tells the reducer how to change the state. It must contain a type property, and it can contain an optional payload property.
