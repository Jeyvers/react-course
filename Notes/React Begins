What is JSX?

JSX Rules
- return single element
// can be enclosed in a <React.fragment> </React.fragment> or <> </>

- div / section / article or Fragment(follow HTML semantics)

- use camelCase for html attributes

- className instead of class (because in ES6, class is already a keyword).

- every element must have a closing tag (even elements that are supported without closing tags e.g (img, input))

- formatting
// Inline css has a higher specifity than the external css. Note this when using libraries. 

//
Nested Components, React Tools

// Get all react events at react events synthetic
